# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data. The tableau report can be found here.

## Who is our customer?

Looking at the graph below, you can see our highest using customer falls in the age range of 23-45 years old. 

Des Moines, Iowa has a larger population percentage of people under the age of 18 than NYC does (24.5% vs 20.9%). Because Des Moines has a large incoming younger generation, they have a higher chance of a steady stream of incoming customers than NYC. 

## What is being used?

Looking at this graph, you can see the average trip duration for Citibikes in NYC. There is a high, steady average trip duration after the 1970's. Younger people have a higher average trip duration than older ones. In today's society, Millennials are more conscious about the environment and emmitting greenhouse gases from automobiles. Also,  not all Millennials are able to afford a car. Because of this, more are driven to use public transportation or biking as a means of getting by. 

## Bike utilization Hours

In this graph, you can see that Citibikes are utilized the most right after work times, (16:00-19:00). 70.2% of the civilian labor force population in Des Moines is over the age of 16 years old, where in NY it is only 63.5%. This leads me to believe that bikes will be used even more in Des Moines after work. 

We see a trend of higher use of bikes after work hours, which leads us to believe that more
of the civilian labor force will use this as a means of transportation. 

Also, the mean travel time to work in Des Moines is only 19 minutes- which is a lot easier to do on a bike than a 41 minute average commute which New Yorkers have. The people in Des Moines will consider biking as a mode of transportation for their everyday use to and from work because of a shorter commute.
